# glazy_scraper
script that scrapes recipes and images from glazy

## NOTES:
It would be really helpful to have access to the databse itself, if that ever happens:
- Would be amazing to incorporate kiln schedules as that seems to impact crystal growth
- Would be way faster.


## How to use:
- scrape recipes w/ images form glazy.org
- manupulate the data,
- download the images
- train ai
